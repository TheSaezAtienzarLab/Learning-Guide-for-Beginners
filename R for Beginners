# Welcome to the Saez Atienzar Lab!

Welcome to the Saez Atienzar Lab. In our Lab, we apply computational methods to answer biological questions in the field of neurodegeneration.

Whatever your background is in bioinformatics, biology, or any other area, you are welcome! Part of our strength stems from our diverse educational backgrounds. 

if you are a beginner in the data science world, this guide is for you.


# How to start

There are different programming languages that will be used. For the applications in the Lab, we will focus on learning **R**, **Phyton**, and **Linux Shell Scripting**.

This guide aims to provide learning resources for R and R Studio. 

## Start with R for beginners
**R is a programming language** and a software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

### 1. Download and Install R and R studio
[Download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)  and install R and R Studio for your type of computer.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCsJD5t4cFM)  is some info on how to download it.

### 2. Install Swirl and start learning
Write the following command in the R Studio command and press 1. This will take you to **R Programming: The basics of programming in R.**
```bash
